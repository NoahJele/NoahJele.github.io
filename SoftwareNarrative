	The artifact used for my software design/engineering enhancement is a project I worked on in my CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance course. The name of this artifact is medicalApplication. The point of this program is to represent a medical system that can add patients/doctors, add medical records, and more. The bigger point of this project in the context of our course was to develop JUnit tests for each relevant function. I originally developed this project several months ago.
