# Welcome!
This is my E-Portfolio for my SNHU CS-499 Course, and will show off multiple enhancements of artifacts that I've worked on in the past. Each enhancement will include a narrative explaining the enhancement, and also an initial code review of each artifact. The first work to appear on this portfolio will be a Professional Self Assessment.

# Code Review
My code review was the first step I took to enhancing my projects. In my review, I thoroughly went through each artifact in order to determine its functionality, as well as room for improvement for each one. [Click on this to view the code review.](https://youtu.be/ZAZzl17PZ5k?t=0)
